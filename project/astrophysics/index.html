<h3 style="color:white; text-align:center; font-size:100px; font-weight:bold;">1. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)</h1><br>


<p style="color:white;  font-size:30px;"><br>

Galileo (born February 15, 1564, Pisa [Italy]â€”died January 8, 1642, Arcetri, near Florence) was an Italian natural philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the sciences of motion, astronomy, and strength of materials and to the development of the scientific method. His formulation of (circular) inertia, the law of falling bodies, and parabolic trajectories marked the beginning of a fundamental change in the study of motion. His insistence that the book of nature was written in the language of mathematics changed natural philosophy from a verbal, qualitative account to a mathematical one in which experimentation became a recognized method for discovering the facts of nature. Finally, his discoveries with the telescope revolutionized astronomy and paved the way for the acceptance of the Copernican heliocentric system, but his advocacy of that system eventually resulted in an Inquisition process against him.<br>

<br>

A degreeless son of a court musician, Galileo Galilei was a rebel if there ever was one. The Italianâ€™s contributions are wide-ranging and impressive â€“ pioneering several aspects of astronomy â€“ and earned him the title of â€˜father of modern scienceâ€™ (given to him by Einstein, no less). His work included fiddling with and improving the telescope (discovering a handful of astronomical features, such as a couple of Jupiterâ€™s moons, while he was at it), running experiments to show how gravity causes the same acceleration regardless of mass, and defending the heliocentric model of the solar system. Much of the latter philosophy stemmed from his predecessors and colleagues such as Nicolaus Copernicus (who first formulated heliocentricity) and Johannes Kepler (who refined the Copernican model and postulated three laws of planetary motion). <br>

ðŸ”­ Astronomy Discoveries:<br>
Moons of Jupiter (1610):<br>

He discovered 4 large moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto (now called the Galilean moons).<br>

This was HUGE because it showed not everything revolves around Earth!<br>

<br>

Phases of Venus:<br>

He observed that Venus has phases like the Moon.<br>

This proved that Venus orbits the Sun, not Earth â€” supporting the heliocentric model.<br>

<br>

Saturnâ€™s Rings:
<br>
He saw something strange around Saturn with his telescope.<br>

Later, it was understood to be rings.
<br>
Mountains and Craters on the Moon<br>

Using his telescope, he saw that the Moon wasn't smooth â€” it had mountains and craters, just like Earth!<br>

<br>

Milky Way = Many Stars:<br>

Galileo discovered the Milky Way is made up of countless tiny stars.<br>

<br>

ðŸ§ª Physics Discoveries:<br>
<br>

Law of Falling Bodies<br>

1. He showed that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their weight (ignoring air resistance).<br>

This was against what Aristotle believed for 2,000 years!<br>

2. Inertia (early idea of Newton's First Law)<br>

He suggested that objects keep moving unless something stops them â€” a big step toward Newton's Laws of Motion.<br>

3. Pendulum Motion<br>

He found that pendulums take the same time to swing, no matter how far they go (as long as the swing is small).<br>

This idea helped with making accurate clocks.<br>
